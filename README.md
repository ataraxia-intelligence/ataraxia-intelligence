# Ataraxia Intelligence

**Ataraxia Intelligence** is a research collective developing responsible, transparent and clinically meaningful Medical AI.  
Our work focuses on Deep Learning, large language models (LLMs), multimodal decision-support systems and ethically aligned AI for oncology and urology.

> **Mission:** Clarity in Clinical Intelligence.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Ataraxia Intelligence originates from projects within the Department of Urology at University Hospital Dresden, including:

- Fine-tuning large language models on **12,000+ pre-therapeutic prostate cancer tumor board cases** to generate AI-assisted treatment recommendations. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Comparative development of classical ML models and modern LLM-based pipelines for diagnostic and therapeutic decision support. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Creation of a structured **renal tumor / RCC database** for future multimodal AI development. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Planning and documentation of data pipelines, anonymization workflows and model evaluation frameworks. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

Our long-term vision is a multimodal medical AI system that integrates text, imaging and—later—genomics to support individualized cancer care.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Responsible Medical AI**  
   Transparent and ethically grounded AI that supports—never replaces—clinical decision-making.

2. **LLM-based Decision Support**  
   - Fine-tuning open-source LLMs  
   - RAG integration with clinical guidelines  
   - Evaluation via concordance, overtreatment and undertreatment metrics  
   - Expert adjudication and benchmark comparison

3. **Multimodal Intelligence**  
   Combining clinical text, imaging, pathology and structured data into unified decision-support architectures.

4. **Ethical Foundations**  
   The name *Ataraxia* reflects calm, rational, unbiased judgement—a philosophical anchor for Medical AI.

## 🧱 Data Governance Principles

- **Clinical patient data remains strictly within hospital infrastructure.**  
- **No patient-identifiable data is ever stored in this repository.**  
- Only *fully anonymized* datasets, model weights, code, and documentation may be used outside clinical systems.
- Public demos use either synthetic data or heavily anonymized samples.

---

## 📁 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the central entry point for:

- Architectural documentation  
- Research design  
- Model descriptions and evaluation summaries  
- Pipelines and roadmap  
- Public demos (future)  
- Collaboration and onboarding information

Additional repositories (models, RAG, demos, docs) will be added as the project expands.
